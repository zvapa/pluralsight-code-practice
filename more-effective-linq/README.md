This collection follows through [this](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/linq-more-effective/table-of-contents) Pluralsight course on effective usage of LINQ in C#.

I created a project for each code challenge I have come across in the tutorial.
The goal was for me to solve the exercises before knowing the answer, since that is the best way to learn.  
I've used Visual Studio (instead of LinqPad, which is what the instructor is using) and made use of some of the newer features of C# (like expression bodied methods) here and there.
LINQ is cool, not only it makes code more succinct, it also adds readability (if used sensibly).
