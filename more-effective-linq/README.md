This collection follows through this Pluralsight course on effective usage of LINQ in C#.
I created a project for each code challenge I have come across in the tutorial.
The goal was for me to solve the exercises before knowing the answer, since that is the best way to learn.  
I've ported the code to Visual Studio (instructor was using LinqPad) and tried to use some of the newer features of C# (like expression bodied methods) here and there.
LINQ is cool, not only it makes code more succinct, it also adds readability.
